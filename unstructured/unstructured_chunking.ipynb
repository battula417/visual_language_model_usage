      "Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conÔ¨Ågurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eÔ¨Äorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\n",

A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the manual speciÔ¨Åcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneÔ¨Åt a broad spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are several practical diÔ¨Éculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneÔ¨Åt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-Ô¨Çedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and Ô¨Åne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the Ô¨Ånal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diÔ¨Écult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiÔ¨Åcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.\n",
